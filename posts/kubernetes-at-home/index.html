Services such as Grafana and Kibana are essential for monitoring and observability for my entire home lab environment. A few of the other services not pictured, for brevity:</p><ul><li><strong>phpIPAM</strong> - Network IP management and tracking database</li><li><strong>LDAP Self-Service Portal</strong> - A simple self-service web application for managing LDAP/Active Directory passwords</li><li><strong>phpMyAdmin</strong> - Web-based management interface for my external MariaDB/Galera database cluster</li></ul><h2 id=storage>Storage<a href=#storage class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>One recent addition to my lab environment is <a href=https://ceph.io/>Ceph</a>.</p><p>One of the most difficult and frustrating problems of managing containerized applications across multiple hosts is data persistence and replication - especially when operating on bare metal. In my professional experience managing platforms such as <em>Azure Kubernetes Service</em>, I&rsquo;ve been able to leverage the built-in StorageClass drivers such as <code>AzureFile</code> and <em>Azure Managed Disks</em> for each managed Kubernetes environment.</p><p>When you&rsquo;re on bare metal, however, you&rsquo;re left to fend for yourself. I found Ceph much more complicated to configure at first than GlusterFS, but more resilient and overall easier to integrate into my K8s environment.</p><h2 id=ingress-and-load-balancing>Ingress and Load Balancing<a href=#ingress-and-load-balancing class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been using Traefik as an Ingress Controller for Docker for several years, and it&rsquo;s greatly simplified the ingress routing configuration of each of my services.</p><p>Traefik has built-in ACME support which allows me to utilize Let&rsquo;s Encrypt for solutions that I host on an external domain (i.e., this website and my NextCloud instance). For services on my internal LAN domain, I employ <a href=https://cert-manager.io/>cert-manager</a> to automatically generate and manage TLS certificates from an internal Certificate Authority based on certificate requests from any workloads deployed to my cluster.</p><p>Similarly to storage, another hard problem of bare-metal K8s is the lack of a network-level load balancer to bring ingress traffic to your cluster. K8s doesn&rsquo;t have any integrated functionality to provide a cluster-wide, externally-accessible IP address for Services. The most effective solution to this problem that I&rsquo;ve found thus far is <a href=https://metallb.universe.tf/>MetalLB</a>. MetalLB interacts with your external network infrastructure - whether through Layer 2 ARP or Layer 3 routing protocols - to provide Services with an external IP address through the existing LoadBalancer Service type.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/case-for-homelab-security/><span class=button__icon>←</span>

We begin to take things for granted.</p><p>For instance, we put all of our important files - recipes, documents, photos, home videos, etc. - on &ldquo;the server&rdquo;. The contents of said server are invaluable to us, economically and emotionally. I take very specific steps to ensure the safety of our data, including ZFS volume-level encryption and frequent encrypted backups to an off-site backup provider. (Shoutout to <a href=https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html>Backblaze B2</a>!)</p><p>Having reliable, 24x7 access to all of my family&rsquo;s data is one hell of an accomplishment, but it&rsquo;s not enough any more. I&rsquo;ve seen too many software vulnerabilities in my still-young IT career to be able to blindly trust any single layer of application security. For the same reasons that my data needs to remain safe and accessible, I also need to keep it secure from prying eyes and malicious actors.</p><p>The IT Infosec landscape of today is almost unrecognizable compared to when I started in IT just over 10 years ago. Back then, vendors were clawing their way into our voicemails, inboxes, and conference rooms to pitch some all-encompassing enterprise security platform that promised to keep mysterious hooded hackers out of your unauthenticated SMB 1 file shares and publicly-accessible SharePoint sites.</p><p>Today, the vendors are still there and eager as ever to give you a four-hour sales demo - but as an industry we&rsquo;ve also adopted a lot of common-sense policies that thankfully don&rsquo;t take a multi-million-dollar contract and six figures worth of computing resources to maintain. Namely:</p><ul><li>Password-protect everything</li><li>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</li><li>Configure Single Sign-On (SSO) wherever possible</li><li>Perhaps most importantly, HTTPS <strong>absolutely everywhere</strong></li></ul><p>If you follow even just half of the policies above, I promise you - your lab will be just as secure, if not more secure, than the majority of corporate IT environments you&rsquo;ll come across.</p><p>That being said, here are the steps I&rsquo;m taking to secure my home lab:</p><ol><li>Implement an internal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for my local domain,</li><li>Secure all TLS-capable services on my local network with certificates from the internal PKI, and</li><li>Setup auto-renewal to allow short certificate lifespans (days to weeks) without manual intervention or rotation.</li></ol><p>I fully intend for this blog to be a place for learning and sharing my experiences, so in a coming post I&rsquo;ll attempt to document every step of the process and write about a few of the hurdles I had to overcome. I&rsquo;ll also share my thoughts on a few **** of the fantastic open-source products that I tried out along the way.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/implementing-a-private-ca-for-home-use/><span class=button__icon>←</span>

I'm a software developer, cloud platform engineer, technology architect, and MBA. I have specific interests in networking, cloud infrastructure, digital supply chains, and distributed systems.

Most of my attention these days has been focused on Kubernetes and cloud-native computing. I'm actively looking for open-source projects to contribute to.

If you'd like to see more of me, follow me on socials or check out my GitHub for a look at my latest projects.

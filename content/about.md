I'm a developer, DevOps engineer, and technology architect. I have specific interests in networking, cloud infrastructure and architecture, and distributed systems.

Most of my attention these days has been focused on Kubernetes and cloud-native computing. I'm actively looking for open-source projects to contribute to.

If you'd like to see more of me, follow me on Twitter or check out my GitHub.

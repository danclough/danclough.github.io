"Was that in the notes?"

"Where'd you learn that?"

"How do you just _know_ that?"

These are all questions I've been asked, in one form or another, over the last 10 years of working in IT.  The situations vary, but there's a common thread to each - an issue identified, a problem solved, a better way to complete some task.

Most of the time, I don't answer.  How do you explain that you knew that _one specific thing_ because of the three hours you spent last month sitting in your cold basement, begging your production NAS to start back up after an upgrade?  Well, it's not _production, per se_... but to your family or roommates, it may as well be.  "It's a long story.  I've seen it before.  Not here - on my server at home."

Engineering knowledge is a perishable resource.  Its decay comes not just from continual technological advancement, but from your own experiential half-life as well.  I haven't touched a Cisco device in over a year and my last Cisco cert has since lapsed.  I could still poke around in the IOS CLI with a little fumbling and an embarrassing overuse of the `?`, but I doubt I could set up an eBGP neighbor on-demand without a reference page and a few minutes of review to jog my memory.

Other times, it's not even the knowledge itself that you benefit from.  The information is out there - you're free to access it as needed.  The concepts __ are what you really need to succeed.  You'll have a much harder time accomplishing things with the reference pages and a few minutes of study when you never had the opportunity to explore routing and BGP concepts in the first place.

Having a homelab is a quick and easy way to stand out as a professional.  That statement holds true whether you're a specialist or a generalist, a 10-year veteran or just starting out in Tech.
